\Prog{hpcproftt} generates textual dumps of profile files.

\end{Name}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Synopsis}

\Prog{hpcproftt} \Arg{profile-file}...


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Description}

\Prog{hpcproftt} generates textual dumps of profile files.
The profile list may contain either flat or call path profile files.


Warnings:
\begin{itemize}
\item On ISA's with variable sized instructions, histogram buckets (4 bytes in size) may contain information for more than one instruction.
In this case, multiple instructions will report counts for the \emph{same} bucket.

\item On some architectures, delays between event triggers, interrupt generation and sampling of the IP means that an event may be associated with a different instruction than one that caused the event.  It is not abnormal for this gap to be 50-70 instructions wide.
\end{itemize}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Arguments}

\begin{Description}
\item[\Arg{profile-file}...] A list of flat profile files.
\end{Description}

Default values for an option's optional arguments are shown in \{\}.

\subsection{Options: General}

\begin{Description}
\item[\OptoArg{-v}{n}, \OptoArg{--verbose}{n}] Verbose: generate progress messages to stderr at verbosity level \Arg{n}.  \{1\} 
\item[\Opt{-V}, \Opt{--version}] Print version information.
\item[\Opt{-h}, \Opt{--help}] Print help.
\item[\OptoArg{--debug}{n}]   Debug: use debug level \Arg{n}. \{1\}
