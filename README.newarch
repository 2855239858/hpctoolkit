This, the newarch branch of hpctoolkit, is Mark's branch for updating
hpctoolkit to run on new architectures such as powerpc/le and ARM.

Note: use devtools's newarch branch for autoreconf on this branch to
keep the autotools revs in sync.

Note: this branch may be unstable at times, and not everything may
build cleanly, especially for the new platforms.
